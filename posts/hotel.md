In accordance with Polish custom, we will provide the hotel accomodation for the night of reception. 

We'd like to recommend the Klasztorna 25 hotel (http://www.klasztorna25.pl/), well located in the center of Pozna≈Ñ; it will make a good base for visiting the city :)

Of course, you can choose to stay at another place if you prefer. Let us know where you decide to stay.
