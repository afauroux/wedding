# How to get there

## Plane from France or Belgium

- Direct flight with low costs like [Ryanair](https://www.ryanair.com/fr/fr/) and [Wizzair](https://wizzair.com/fr-fr#/), starting from 20‚Ç¨ ! (but from Beauvais), or more expensive flights from bigger airports.

## Train (the green option)

- They are [trains](https://www.bahn.com/fr) from Belgium and France to Pozna≈Ñ passing through Germany, they are very comfy but usually more expensive than the plane, a bit longer and usually with one or two changes. (around 11h from Paris)

## Car

- Just [drive](https://goo.gl/maps/pNnWszmpXtveqbR58) straight through the autobahn at max speed, and pause for [Curry wursts](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/e4/fe/7f/currywurst-normal-und.jpg) or [Schweinshaxes](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/schweinshaxe-pork-knuckle-bavarian-44736198.jpg) (around 13h if you drive at the limit and without pause, so you'll have to sleep on the way)
