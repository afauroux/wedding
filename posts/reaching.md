# How to get there

# by plane
Cheap direct flights leave regularly from both Paris Beauvais (Ryanair and Wizzair) and Brussels Charleroi (Ryanair). There are also flights from Paris CDG with a change in Warsaw (LOT).

# by train
Poznań is relatively easy to reach by train from Paris or Brussels with 2 changes (usually in Cologne/Frankfurt-am-Main and Berlin). This year, SNCF and Deutsche Bahn are supposed to launch a direct 7h route from Paris to Berlin, so stay tuned!

# by car
Poznań can be reached by car in around 11 hours from Brussels and 14 hours from Paris.
